# Flutter beginner guides

I will cover essential topics for Flutter beginners.

> Make sure to cover [how_to_start_learning_flutter](00_how_to_start_learning_flutter.md) if you haven't completed that.

There is a difference between doing things and doing them in a good way. The compiler can execute your code, but it can be difficult to read for other devs and humans.

This differentiates good programmers from bad ones.

## Code writing

You can follow from here. Not all need to be covered, but just leaving them in case someone is interested:

- [ ] Must follow [effective-dart](https://dart.dev/effective-dart)
- [ ] _The Clean Code_ by Uncle Bob
- [ ] _The Design Patterns_ by Head First and GOF
- [ ] Design pattern YouTube playlist by [Christopher Okhravi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ejT8FO-7I&list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc)

After learning a few patterns, you will start overthinking and over-engineering. Yes, mid-level programmers make things complex and write complex code by taking these different patterns **as rules instead of guidance.**

> **These are guidelines, not rules that must be followed in every scenario.**

Keep things simple, but don't use others' easy code without a certain understanding of their abstraction.

### Learn by doing

Yap, learn by doing stuff. We always say fake it till you make it.

But just watching and doing like monkey people might not get you anywhere. Make sure you understand at a certain level.

Another type of developer (-/\_) can be seen as a vibe coder.

#### Here are a few things

1. You can do a thing and don't know what it is doing.
2. You can't do a thing but know this is supposed to be working.
3. You can do a thing and know at a certain level what it is doing.
4. And obviously, the last one is those who can't do a thing and don't even acknowledge that they don't know â€” vibe coders.

So know what you're doing, at least at a certain level. Many devs add a bunch of libraries and dependencies just for simple features. This is how we easily distinguish between a good developer and a bad developer.

I am not saying it is bad to use a package or library. You should use the ones you understand and know that:

- it has been made by people you trust
- it is future reliable  
  There are a bunch of packages that can be found to do a thing. Just find the one that has fewer Git issues and is well-maintained.
