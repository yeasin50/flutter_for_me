\section{Shared Preferences}
When it comes to storing simple key-value pair data, 
this is the simplest solution for most use cases. 
It is created by the Flutter team and supports all platforms. 
If you need to persist user data that can be identified by a primary keyword, Shared Preferences is a great choice.

\subsection{Common Use Cases}

Shared Preferences is commonly used for tracking user settings and history:

\begin{itemize} 
  \item{\faMoon\ \textbf{Light/Dark Mode selection}} 
  \item{\faGlobe\ \textbf{Preferred language selection}} 
  \item{\faCheckCircle\ \textbf{Tracking if the user has completed onboarding}}  
  \item{\faVolumeUp\ \textbf{Sound settings/history}} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supported Data Types}

Shared Preferences supports the following data types:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Dart]
    String, int, bool, double, List<String>
\end{lstlisting}
you can use other type by converting into string/jsonEncoding and decoding,
but there are other good options for that later in this video
